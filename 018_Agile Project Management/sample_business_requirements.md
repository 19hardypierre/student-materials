# Title

## Executive Summary

The Exeter Web Application should be able to make connections between multiple students with disparate expertise, when working on projects. As the project progresses, more expertise may be referred to for proposed involvement.

## Business Objectives

This project will prove invaluable in pooling together, anticipated intellectual resources for any project. The goal is to minimize the search for capable persons and expand technological networking.

## Background

This project would facilitate students in engaging and connecting with other students, thus opening their minds to expand their network.

## Scope

*The Scope section should outline what is and is not included as part of this project.  Oftentimes we make assumptions of features or functionality that is not necessarily required.  This is especially useful in a phased approach or when working on an existing system.*

## Functional requirements

The development of this project should involve the following:
Students should have the option to create an Avatar for privacy; the student should be able to list their area of expertise and secondary strengths. Students must be able to fill-in identifying fields in their files; The students will need the ability to create online "Avatars" to facilitate privacy; a category list with sub-categories must be developed to identify projects elements that may be required; there should be a list of potentially available candidates who may be interested, to select from; The user should be able to input requirments for projects, allowing the system to provide more options.

## Personnel requirements
The only requirements will be for each student to provide a profile in order to network their expertise.
## Delivery schedule

*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*

## Other requirements

*This section serves as a catch-all for any details that may not fit in other areas.  things like device or browser support, considerations for accessibility or inspiration for style.  Offer additional context here to ensure the project meets your vision*

## Assumptions

*Oftentimes we are reliant on outside sources such as frameworks to be used, or services that our system will depend on.  In this section you should provide detail on any assumptions that you have made, such as the system being reliant on the availability of the Google Maps API.*

## Limitations

*Identify any limitations in terms of time, personnel, technical details, or other things that limit the scope, time, and cost of the project being discussed.*

## Risks

*Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project.  You must identify this risks to show you know what they are, and also identify ways in which you would mitigate those risks.*
